 * The ImageManager class is responsible for keeping a local cache of images
 * used in the app, loading and saving images to disk, and downloading remote
 * images and updating the cache and disk with the recently downloaded images.
 * It also provides a mechanism to cancel previous download handler operations,
 * aimed at high performance when used in conjunction with UITableView and

 * downloaded from the provided remote url, saved in both the cache and on
 * disk, and the provided handler block is called with the image.

 * cache and the path for the image to be loaded on or saved to disk.
 *
 * @param urlString The string representation of the remote url for this image

 * downloaded from the provided url.
