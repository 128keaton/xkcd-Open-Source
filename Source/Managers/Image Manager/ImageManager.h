/**
 * The ImageManager class is responsible for keeping a local cache of images
 * used in the app, loading and saving images to disk, and downloading remote
 * images and updating the cache and disk with the recently downloaded images.
 * It also provides a mechanism to cancel previous download handler operations,
 * aimed at high performance when used in conjunction with UITableView and
 * UIScrollView cell reuse.

/**
 * Returns an image with a given filename if it's present in our image cache or
 * from disk if we have it stored. If the image isn't in the cache or in disk it
 * is then downloaded from the provided remote url, saved in both the cache and
 * on disk, and the provided download handler block is called with the image as
 * the only parameter.
 *
 * @param filename The name of the file that will be used as the key in the image
 * cache and the path for the image to be loaded on or saved to disk.
 *
 * @param urlString The string representation of the remote url for this image
 * that will be used to download the image if it is not present in the cache
 * or on disk.
 *
 * @param downloadHandler A block that will be called only when an image is
 * not found in our cache, not found on disk, and successfully downloaded from
 * the provided url.
 *
 * @return The image loaded from our cache or on disk, if present; nil otherwise.
